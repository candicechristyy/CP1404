1. I saw the number 19 for line 1, the smallest number I could have seen is 5 and the largest number would be 20.
2. I saw "3" on line 3, the smallest number I could have seen is 3, and the largest number would be 9. Line 2 couldn't produce 4 because the line 2 can only produce number from 3 to 9 in steps of 2, so the only numbers that can appear are 3, 5, 7, and 9.
3. I saw the number 4.152533511615266 on line 3. The smallest number I could have seen is 2.5 and the largest number would be 5.5.
