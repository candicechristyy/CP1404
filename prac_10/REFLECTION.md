# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## Estimates

Regarding the **estimates** that you did for practical tasks...

### How was your estimate accuracy usually?

My estimations ended up being quite close to the actual time.

### How did your estimate accuracy improve or change during the course of the subject?

It improved as I do more coding tasks, learning more on how long I work on each task each time.
Hence, overtime, my estimation skills became better.

### What did you learn from doing these estimates?

I learned that it is useful to break down the task into parts and track how long I do for each part.
In that way, I can improve my estimations further.

## Code Reviews

### What have you learned from being reviewed by other people?

Being reviewed enabled me to identify minor errors and inefficiencies in my code that I usually would not have spotted. 
With this, I learned that it is important to get feedback from other people in order to detect
mistakes I don't notice at first, helping me develop a better, cleaner code.

### What have you learned from doing code reviews of other people?

I learned to identify common errors and proper coding practices by looking over other people's work.
Additionally, I became more perceptive and critical, particularly when it came to determining whether their solution satisfied the objectives and whether it was clear and efficient.

Provide proper Markdown links (not bare URLs) to two (2) PRs that show you doing good code reviews for any of the past
pracs.  
For each one, write a short explanation of what was good about your review.

### Good Code Review 1

[Practical 6 - programming_language.py](https://github.com/ChaoYuyang1919810/prac6/pull/1/files/eb6f94e5d3c479e3aa1f7e230072c561ca0a0752)

### Explanation

I mentioned in this review that because Python has a built-in module called typing, the variable name 'typing' could cause confusion.
I suggested changing its name to something like typing_style in order to make it more clear and prevent shadowing of the module.
This type of suggestion increases code maintainability and helps avoid errors in the future.


### Good Code Review 2

[Practical 6 - languages.py](https://github.com/ChaoYuyang1919810/prac6/pull/1/files/eb6f94e5d3c479e3aa1f7e230072c561ca0a0752)

### Explanation

Although the code is short, I suggested that it is great practice to wrap the code execution within a main() function.
This enhances scalability and structure, particularly as projects expand.
Additionally, it adheres to Python conventions, which is beneficial for programming of a high quality.

## Practicals

### Regarding the **practical tasks** overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?

I feel that the practical tasks overall is fine as it is currently, so I wouldn't change anything.

### What did you do really well for practicals in this subject?

I was able to complete and submit practicals for each week on time.
Other than that, I made sure my code fits with the tasks' objectives.
